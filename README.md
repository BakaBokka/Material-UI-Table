### Trying Mateial UI. Made with React, TypeScript and, yes, Material UI.

* There is a Main page, from witch you can navigate to the tables
* Next there is a General table with all the users
* And there is a Groups table, with few subtables sorted by group
* Sort columns by clicking at the table header
* Add new row by clicking "Add new row" button


****
### You need to start the local server before trying the application.
See instructions below.
